        <h2>What is Wi-Fi</h2>

        <p> Well where dose Wifi come from, how dose it work and dose it come from satllights? Well to send somthing
        to the
        internet (Like you clicking on this web page), this is how it works. The first thind that needs to
        happen is your
        computers wierless adapter translates data into a Raidio signal or wave, form there a wierless router
        receves the
        signal and decodes it usting lang="utf-8" an html comand that encodes and decodes the signal in wich a
        computer
        can decode it.
    </p>

    <p>

        This is a universal process, in wich it works in reverce to send a signal to your computer the process
        is repeted in reverce, everything frome the encoeing to decodeing.

    <h2>But how does my router pick up signal?</h1>

<image class="text-image" src="router.png">
            
    <p>
        Your WiFi signal is transmitted using radio waves. There are two main steps: The device's wireless adapter
        translates
        data into a radio signal. The wireless router receives the signal, decodes it, and sends information to the
        Internet
        using its physical Ethernet connection.

    <h2>Wait What type of waves are our Wifi signal made of?</h1>
        
<image class="text-image" src="z.eathernet.png"></image>

    <p>
        Our wifi signal is made of radio waves! these specific wave work best because, WiFi actually operates at
        quite precise frequencies,
        either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, which correspond to wavelengths of either 12 cm or 6 cm. This is perfect for our
        Wifi because it cant be
        seen or heard but can be prossesed into our WiFI signal!S

    <h2>But wait how do we get WiFi from space?</h2>

    <image class="text-image" src="wifi tower.png">

    <p>Satellite ISPs like Viasat work in essentially the same three-step fashion, but instead of a central station, the
    internet signal is delivered via fiber to a large antenna (called an “earth station”) on the ground, which then moves
    the signal via radio waves up to our satellite.
